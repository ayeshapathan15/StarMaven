# Siri-Like Voice Assistant Guide

## Overview
Your app now includes a powerful multilingual voice assistant that works exactly like Siri. Once you log in, it automatically starts listening for wake words and can process commands in multiple languages.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Activation
- The voice assistant automatically starts when you log into the app
- It runs in the background, continuously listening for wake words
- No manual setup required - it's ready to use immediately

### 2. Wake Words (Supported in Multiple Languages)
Say any of these wake words to activate the assistant:

**English:**
- "Hey Nova"
- "OK Nova" 
- "Nova"
- "Hey Assistant"
- "Assistant"

**Hindi:**
- "‡§π‡•á ‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡§æ" (He Nova)
- "‡§ì‡§ï‡•á ‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡§æ" (OK Nova)
- "‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡§æ" (Nova)
- "‡§Ö‡§∏‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü" (Assistant)
- "‡§∏‡§π‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï" (Sahayak)

**Spanish:**
- "Hola Nova"
- "OK Nova"
- "Nova"
- "Asistente"

**And many more languages including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Arabic!**

### 3. Voice Commands
After saying a wake word, you can give commands like:

**English:**
- "Add sugar"
- "Add milk to the list"
- "I need bread"
- "Put rice in the list"

**Hindi:**
- "‡§ö‡•Ä‡§®‡•Ä add ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã" (Cheeni add karo)
- "‡§¶‡•Ç‡§ß ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§è" (Dudh chahiye)
- "‡§ö‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤ list ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§°‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã" (Chawal list mein dalo)

**Marathi:**
- "‡§∏‡§æ‡§ñ‡§∞ ‡§ò‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ" (Sakhar ghya)
- "‡§¶‡•Ç‡§ß list ‡§Æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ü‡§æ‡§ï" (Dudh list madhye tak)

### 4. Visual Feedback
When activated, you'll see:
- A beautiful animated popup (just like Siri)

  - Blue: Listening for wake word

## Usage Tips

1. **Speak Clearly**: Speak in a normal voice, not too fast or slow

3. **Use Natural Language**: Say commands naturally - "add sugar" or "I need milk"
4. **Manual Trigger**: Tap the floating microphone button if needed
5. **Multiple Languages**: You can switch languages mid-conversation

## Troubleshooting

**Assistant not responding?**
- Check if you're logged in
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Try the manual trigger button

**Commands not working?**
- Speak clearly and wait for the "Yes?" response
- Try using simpler commands like "add [item name]"
- Check if the item is in the supported list

**Wrong language detected?**
- The assistant learns from your speech patterns
- Try speaking more clearly in your preferred language
- Use wake words in your target language

## Privacy & Permissions

Your voice data is processed securely and not stored permanently.
